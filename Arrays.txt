1. Write a program to remove the duplicate elements in an array and print the same.
2. Write a program to print sum of element in following condition.
   If the array has 6 and 7 in succesdding order , ignore the numbers between 6 and 7 , 
   consider the other numbers to calculate the sum.
	Example: Input: 10, 3,6,1,2,7,9
	Output:22

3. Print a version of the given array where all the 10's have been removed. The remaining elements should shift left towards 
the start of the array as needed, and the empty spaces at the end of the array should be 0. So, {1, 10, 10, 2} yields {1,2, 0,0}.
You may modify and display the given array or make a new array.

withoutTen([1,10,10,2]) -> [1,2,0,0]
withoutTen([10,2,10]) -> [2,0,0]
